EMI Calculation:
EMI = [P x R x (1+R)^N] / [(1+R)^N – 1]
Where:
P = Principal loan amount
R = Monthly interest rate
N = Number of monthly installments

Prepayment Rules:
Some banks allow prepayment with minimal charges. Charges vary by loan type and bank policy.

Late Payment Penalties:
Late EMI payments may attract penalty fees and impact credit score. Exact penalty rates depend on bank policy.
